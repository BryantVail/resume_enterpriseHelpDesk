	Enterprise Technical Support


  Learning & being able to continue growing through building new skills is my passion, this is what brings me to apply for Enterprise Technical support. A chance to leave a mark on this department, and the industry I choose to work in is my motive to find the best practices. Not to stop at just technical solutions, I embrace the continuous search for the best ways to communicate the resolution through the foundation of genuine concern for the right solution, and build on it credibility from transparency that doesn't sacrifice the brand I represent. Within Enterprise Support I am looking forward to adding experience to my knowledge and being elevated by the influence of my colleagues.
	Since entering the technology field in a professional position 4 years ago, I've taken on the mindset of keeping the weight of the internet and computing as an economic cornerstone present in mind to stay hungry. Each step is more motivation, going from residential support under Bright House Networks, moving into more responsibility with the Small Medium Business Department- Working closely alongside Joel Nichols, and others who have made the transition to Enterprise- I only grow more eager to strive for technically sound deductions.
	Intrigue for the flow of information that moves this world has driven me toward traditional & self-driven education. Obtaining my A+ CompTIA Cert in my off time has led me to a place where I benefit from being immersed in a good amount of Net+ experience as I strive for more network based competencies. My Computer Programming Specialist certificate has proven to offer me a clearer perspective for when an error or problem is more likely to be in the upper 3 layers of the OSI model. Software development skills & a greater understanding of application flow- especially in the backdrop of internet communication- I also believe helps me stay cognizant of the factors that can be significant in the context of network support.
	I chose this industry by deciding to take my inspiration to do my best for others & framing it around the most impactful curriculum the world has ever seen. Fortunate, I have been around an array of support environments in both hardware & software. Case wellness, a skill that has taken a backseat in many other support environments, was a staple at both the Microsoft Account I was a part of, as well as with BHN. I have found, being on both sides of the fence, that efficiency does not have to be "quick & dirty"; leaving the right answer on the table & the customer with little understanding (an underserved support opportunity). I believe in troubleshooting that leads both parties to satisfaction, no matter where the technical disconnect.
	As I continue to prepare for every call in SMB Support, I continue to ready my skills to fit Enterprise Support- daily evaluation of RF levels & probable service impact, LAN configurations & implementation- static IPs( public & private ), including the estimation of the plant's influence on individual subscribers & tipping off our field counterparts toward evidence that may show trending or area impact that can uplift groups of subscribers at a time. Support, when directing resolution for service that includes more variables than others, wireless & VoIP phones, depends on a wholesome look. Alongside the high level of knowledge in what it takes to effectively administer & monitor a network, listening & critical thinking remains important to nail down solutions. When there are many devices & even more circumstances to consider- knowledge above & beyond only the services we offer only strengthen my ability to offer direction & confidence to our customers when their implementation of the technology is specific to their workflow.
